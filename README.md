<i><b>Project created to practice my knowledge in Flask and TailwindCSS.</b></i>

To run the project on your machine:

Make sure you have the Flask framework installed

- Clone the repository
- Run the file "projeto.py"
- Project routes:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/login - <b>"/login"</b> is the project's initial screen. <br>
http://127.0.0.1:5000/mostrar_lista - <b>"/mostrar_lista"</b> is the page displayed after logging in, showing the names of the already created users. <br>
http://127.0.0.1:5000/criar - <b>"/criar"</b> is where a new user is created. <br>

<i>You must be logged in to access the <b>"/mostrar_lista"</b> page.</i>

Initially, there will be no users, so create them and experiment with how the system works. If you encounter any issues, please let me know via email if possible.

<b>Note:</b> None of these users are real, they are not saved anywhere and will disappear when the "projeto.py" file stops running.
